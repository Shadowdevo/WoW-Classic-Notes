# World of Warcraft Classic Leveling Notepad Ver. 0.6

**Hey there!** This is a notepad type program meant to streamline the process of leveling in World of Warcraft Classic. 
This is something that I wanted for myself but I think there might be others who would want this.

I will be updating this as often as possible until I am satisfied with its usability. Feel free to **use** or **modify** this all you want!

If you dig around enough you will find some code from [Joana's website](https://www.joanasworld.com/) and that's because I liked his design and borrowed some of his functions! I have used his leveling guides to level multiple characters and I can't recommend it enough!

### = Functions I plan to implement =

- **Save Button**
  - Save User Inputted Steps
  - Save User Color Text
- **Edit Button**
  - Edit Added Steps
- **Add/Remove Steps**
  - Added in Correct Order + Correct Formatting
- **Notes Section**
- **Color Picker**
  - Allow User to Choose Color of Highlighted Text
